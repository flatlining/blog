On the :doc:`previous <writing-and-reading-image-files-for-the-raspberry-pi>` post we saw how to write the `Arch Linux ARM`_ to be use with the `Raspberry Pi`_.

But Arch is a very flexible distro and it's base configuration is very raw and will need to get your hands a little dirty before you have a fine tuned system to use, but don't worry, it will be fun!
